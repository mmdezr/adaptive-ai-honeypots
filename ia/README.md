# AI and Adaptation Code

This directory contains the machine learning and adaptation logic.

## Main components
- `train_rf.py`: Random Forest training
- `linucb_controller.py`: contextual bandit decision policy
- `actuador_cowrie.py`: runtime profile application

## Analysis scripts
Several scripts ending in `_final`, `_v3`, or similar correspond to
iterative experimental analysis during the project development.
They are kept for reproducibility of results reported in the thesis.
